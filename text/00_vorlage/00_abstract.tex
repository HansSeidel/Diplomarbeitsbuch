Our diploma-project is a horror game. We want to provide tension, fear, and jump scares in high quality. An immersive experience – in a safe environment.

The in-game environment, though, is not safe at all. You will have to navigate through graves, mausolea and other buildings to acquire important objects. Don’t think that it will be easy, as you are not alone.

The adventure is accompanied by an extensive fictional story, which will be explained in-game via various notes. In addition to this, you will be able to find out more about important real-life personas to expand or refresh your knowledge of the world.
