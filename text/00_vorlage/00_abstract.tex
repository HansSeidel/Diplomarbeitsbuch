This book describes the realisation of a basic 3D-game.
The genre of the game belongs to horror.

At the beginning of the game the player is in front of a mausoleum.
During the first sequence the player does not have any controls above the gamecharacter.
The game character walks in front of the entrance and starts looking at a stone plate.
There are seven objects engraved inside the stone plate which the player must find.
While playing the game the play realises he is inside something like a nightmare.
In order to escape the nightmare the player must find the objects to bury himself.

The realisation of the game was made with the 3D-Program: "Blender" and the game-engine: "Unreal Engine".
The next chapters will give a more specifically look at these programs.
