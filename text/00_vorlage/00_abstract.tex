This book describes the realisation of a basic 3D-game.
The genre of the game belongs to horror.

At the beginning of the game the player is in front of a mausoleum.
During the first sequence the player does not have any controls above the gamecharacter.
The game character goes up the stairs and starts looking at a stone plate  in front of the entrance.
There are seven objects engraved inside the stone plate which the player must find.
While playing the game the play realises he is inside something like a nightmare.
In order to escape the nightmare the player must find the objects to bury himself.

The realisation of the game was made with the 3D-Program: "Blender" and the game-engine: "Unreal Engine".
The next chapters will give a more specifically look at these programs.
