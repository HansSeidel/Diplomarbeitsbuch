This book describes the making of a basic 3D-game.
The genre of the game belongs to horror.

At the beginning of the game the player is in front of a mausoleum.
During the first sequence the player is not in control of the main character yet.
The main character walks up the stairs and looks at a stone plate in front of the entrance.
There are seven objects engraved inside the stone plate which the player must find.
While playing the game the player realises he is inside some kind of nightmare.
In order to escape the nightmare the player must find the objects to bury himself.

The game was made with the 3D-Programme "Blender" and the Game-Engine "Unreal Engine 4".
The following chapters will give a more detailed look at these programmes.
